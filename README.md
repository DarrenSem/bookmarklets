A collection of bookmarklets, hopefully closely mirrored in more usable form at http://alanhogan.com/bookmarklets

## Converting to Bookmarklet Form

I will use an online bookmarklet generator like <http://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/> (which seems the most robust — I have formerly used <http://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/>) to convert these into bookmarklet form. Why? (It’s easy, after all: Just add `javascript:` in front and maybe URL-encode the script, right?) For consistency and reproducibility. 

Sometimes I will use CoffeeScript for the source because, dammit, it’s just easier to write better code in CoffeeScript. I gave a talk to this effect a few times. (Update: yeah, I have mostly broken this habit now. Feel free to submit a pull request using JavaScript instead. You can convert from `.coffee` dead-easy at [coffeescript.org](http://coffeescript.org).)

This repo is here largely so I can have one source of truth: The files in this reposititory. (The alternative is bouncing between bookmarklet and more readable formats, which is less than ideal, and which loses comments.)
