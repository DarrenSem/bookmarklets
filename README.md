## Converting to Bookmarklet Form

I will use an online bookmarklet generator, particularly <https://alanhogan.github.io/bookmarkleter/>, which seems the most robust and convenient, to convert these into bookmarklet form. Why? (Itâ€™s easy, after all: Just add `javascript:` in front and maybe URL-encode the script, right?) For consistency and reproducibility. (formerly: [1](http://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/), [2](http://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/).)

This repo is here largely so I can have one source of truth: The files in this reposititory. (The alternative is bouncing between bookmarklet and more readable formats, which is less than ideal, and which loses comments.)
