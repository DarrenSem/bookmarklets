## Converting to Bookmarklet Form

I will use an online bookmarklet generator like <http://bookmarklets.org/maker/> (which seems the most robust — I have formerly used <http://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/>) to convert these into bookmarklet form. Why? (It’s easy, after all: Just add `javascript:` in front and maybe URL-encode the script, right?) For consistency and reproducibility. 

Sometimes I will use CoffeeScript for the source because, dammit, it’s just easier to write better code in CoffeeScript. I gave a talk to this effect a few times.

And to have one source of truth: The files in this reposititory. (The alternative is bouncing between bookmarklet and more readable formats, which seems less than ideal.)
